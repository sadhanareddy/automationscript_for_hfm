<p align="justify">             The purpose of this experiment is to illustrate the influence of Reynolds number on pipe flows. Reynolds number is a very useful dimensionless quantity (the ratio of dynamic forces to viscous forces) that aids in classifying certain flows. For incompressible flow in a pipe Reynolds number based on the pipe diameter, ReD = VaveDρ/μ, serves well. Generally, laminar flows correspond to ReD  4000. However, disturbances in the flow from various sources may cause the flow to deviate from this pattern. This experiment will illustrate laminar, transitional, and turbulent flows in a pipe.              </p> <p> <a href="7.Reynolds_experiment.pdf" target="_blank">Read More</a> </p>
